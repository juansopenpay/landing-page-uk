          <h3>Quick Questions.</h3>


          <button type="button" class="collapsible">How do I shop with Openpay?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Simply select Openpay as your payment method at checkout and you'll be redirected to the Openpay site to create an account in a few quick steps. You'll then be asked to pick your plan length, pay your first instalment and confirm your purchase. We take care of the rest, deducting your payments automatically from your chosen card each month. Easy as that!</p>
          </div>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Do you really charge no interest?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Our plans are always interest free.</p>
          </div>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">What about fees?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>We only charge fees if you miss a payment. Late payment fees are £7.50 (capped at £15
              per plan). If you want to learn about your options to reschedule a payment, give us a call
            before your payment date to avoid late fees.</p>
          </div>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">How much can I spend with Openpay?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>The limit may vary from store to store. It also depends on your financial circumstances.
              If you’re having trouble placing an order with Openpay, try placing an order for a lower
            amount.</p>
          </div>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Is Openpay safe & secure?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Yes, protecting your information is very important to us. All card data is encrypted and we
              maintain stringent physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your
            information.</p>
            <p>View the Openpay privacy policy <a href="https://www.openpay.co.uk/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
          </div>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Does Openpay perform a credit check?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Depending on the purchase amount you are making, you may be asked to consent to a credit check. In those instances, your consent will be clearly requested before a credit check is performed and your Openpay plan is created. Please note, this will lodge a credit check which may impact your credit score.</p>
          </div>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">How do I make payments?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>We take payments automatically on your scheduled date. If you'd like to pay back earlier, you can do this free of charge via your Openpay account.</p> 

          </div>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">When will my next payment be due?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Our plans are made up of equal monthly instalments. Your first instalment is paid on the day
              at checkout, where you can then customise your second instalment date (up to 38 days
              later). All remaining instalments will come out a month apart. If you need to reschedule any
            payment dates, give us a call to learn about your options.</p>
          </div> 

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">What if I want to return my purchase?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Full returns and partial refunds are available. Please return your goods to the merchant they
              were purchased, in line with the merchant’s returns policy. Once approved, you’ll receive a
              full or partial refund of any payments you’ve already made to us. All returns are subject to
            the merchant’s return policy.</p>
